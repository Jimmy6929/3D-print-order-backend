🎯 1. Overview

Amodeling is a web platform where users can:
	•	Upload their own 3D files (STL/OBJ/STEP).
	•	Instantly get pricing based on weight, time, and material.
	•	Place and track 3D printing orders with integrated shipping.

Goal for UI/UX:
Make the process fast, transparent, and friendly, guiding both first‑time and repeat users through upload, pricing, and ordering with minimal friction.

⚡ 5. Key User Flows

Example Flow – Upload to Order:
	1.	Landing → Upload → Preview & Price → Buy Credits → Checkout → Track Order.
	2.	Users upload 3D files directly—no generation step.
	3.	Payment confirmation triggers instant order creation and tracking number.

⸻

🔧 6. Technical Notes for UI/UX
	•	Frontend Tech: Next.js + React, TailwindCSS for styling.
	•	3D Viewer: Integrate Three.js or react‑three‑fiber.
	•	Real-Time Feedback: Show skeleton loaders while analyzing files.
	•	Notifications: Toast alerts for success/error states.
	•	Shipping Labels: Display QR code or download label after order.

⸻

✅ 7. Acceptance Criteria
	•	Users can upload models, see price instantly, and complete checkout in under 3 minutes.
	•	UI elements tested on Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox.
	•	Mobile UX validated on iOS & Android (no horizontal scrolling, tap targets ≥44px).

⸻

📈 8. KPIs for UX
	•	Time to first order < 3 minutes.
	•	Upload-to-order completion rate > 70%.
	•	Support tickets related to navigation < 5% of orders.🎯 1. Overview
