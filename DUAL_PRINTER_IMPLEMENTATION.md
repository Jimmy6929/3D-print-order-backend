# Dual Printer Support Implementation (FDM + Resin)

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented dual printer support allowing users to choose between **FDM** and **Resin** printing technologies with different pricing models. Users now see both pricing options and can select their preferred printing method.

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### 1. **Updated `backend/utils.py`**
- Added `calculate_price_fdm()` for FDM-specific pricing
- Added `calculate_price_resin()` for Resin-specific pricing  
- Added `calculate_dual_pricing()` that returns both options
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `calculate_price()`

**FDM Pricing Structure:**
- Material: £0.02/gram (PLA/PETG)
- Labor: £2.5/hour
- Base fee: £2.00
- Post-processing: £0.00

**Resin Pricing Structure:**
- Material: £0.08/gram (4x more expensive)
- Labor: £1.8/hour (less labor intensive)
- Base fee: £3.00 (higher setup cost)
- Post-processing: £1.50 (washing & curing)

### 2. **Updated `backend/schemas.py`**
- Added `OrderCreate` with `printer_type` field
- Added `OrderConfirm` for order confirmation data
- Updated `OrderResponse` with printer-specific fields
- Added optional fields for both pricing options

### 3. **Updated `backend/main.py`**
- Modified `/upload` endpoint to return dual pricing
- Updated `/confirm-order` to save printer type selection
- Enhanced order data with both pricing options for reference

## 🗃️ Database Schema Changes

Run the provided `database_migration.sql` script in Supabase:

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS printer_type TEXT CHECK (printer_type IN ('fdm', 'resin')) DEFAULT 'fdm',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS material_type TEXT DEFAULT 'PLA',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS estimated_print_time_resin FLOAT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS price_fdm FLOAT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS price_resin FLOAT;
```

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### 1. **New Component: `PrinterSelection.tsx`**
- Beautiful side-by-side comparison of FDM vs Resin
- Real-time pricing display with detailed breakdown
- Technology-specific benefits highlighted
- Automatic order confirmation on selection
- Loading states and error handling

### 2. **Updated `FileUploader.tsx`**
- Modified to work with new dual pricing structure
- Returns `QuoteData` instead of single price
- Updated interfaces to match backend response

### 3. **Updated `pages/index.tsx`**
- Replaced `QuoteDisplay` with `PrinterSelection`
- Enhanced order confirmation with printer type info
- Color-coded confirmation based on selected technology

## 📊 Pricing Comparison Example

For a 25.5g part with 2.5h FDM print time:

| Technology | Price | Time | Material | Benefits |
|------------|--------|------|----------|----------|
| **FDM** | £8.76 | 2.5h | PLA/PETG | Functional parts, stronger materials |
| **Resin** | £9.24 | 1.5h | Photopolymer | Ultra-fine details, smooth finish |

**Key Insights:**
- Resin is ~5.5% more expensive but 40% faster
- Different value propositions for different use cases
- Users can make informed decisions based on their needs

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **File Upload**: User uploads 3D file (STL/OBJ/STEP)
2. **Dual Analysis**: Backend calculates volume, weight, and time
3. **Dual Pricing**: Both FDM and Resin prices calculated
4. **Technology Selection**: User chooses preferred printing method
5. **Order Confirmation**: Order saved with selected printer type
6. **Database Storage**: All data stored with printer-specific fields

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify pricing calculations:
```bash
python3 test_dual_pricing.py
```

This validates:
- Individual pricing functions
- Dual pricing calculations
- Price and time comparisons
- Percentage differences

## 🔗 API Response Format

**New `/upload` endpoint response:**
```json
{
  "quote_id": "uuid",
  "file_url": "supabase_url",
  "pricing_options": {
    "fdm": {
      "price": 8.76,
      "print_time_h": 2.5,
      "material_type": "PLA/PETG",
      "technology": "FDM",
      "details": { /* cost breakdown */ }
    },
    "resin": {
